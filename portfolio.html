        <h1>Hi there! My name is Samira and I am a coder</h1>
      </div>
      <div>  
        <p>Here is a little introduction, Hi my name is samira i am full stack developer specialising in front and back end developing. i started off learning coding at a bootcamp called black codher bootcamp which introduces the tech industry to black females like me. I personally believe it is imperative to have a diverse group of people with equal opportunities in the tech industry.
        i love problem solving because it really mind stimulating for me hence me learning coding.
        in future i would like to continue working in the software engineering world as a fullstack developer.</p>
          <p>During this bootcamp we started off learning HTML CSS language where we created a website like this and learnt the foundations of coding; we then moved on to Javascript. Here's a list of popular programming languages:
              <ul> 
                <li>JavaScript scripting language.</li>
                <li>C/C++ language.</li>
                <li>Java language.</li>
                <li>Python programming.</li>
                    </ul></p>
   Coding is an international language appreciated and utilised around the world. 
   Once this skill is learnt the world is truly your oyster </div>
