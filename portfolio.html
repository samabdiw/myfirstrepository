    </Body>Here is a little introduction, Hi my name is samira i am full stack developer specialising in front and back end developing. i started off learning coding at a bootcamp called black codher bootcamp which introduces the tech industry to black females like me. I personally believe it is imperative to have a diverse group of people with equal opportunities in the tech industry.
    i love problem solving because it really mind stimulating for me hence me learning coding.
    in future i would like to continue working in the software engineering world as a fullstack developer.
   During this bootcamp we started off learning HTML CSS language where we created a website like this and learnt the foundations of coding; we then moved on to Javascript. Here's a list of popular programming languages:
   JavaScript scripting language.
   C/C++ language.
   Java language.
   Python programming.
   Ruby language.
   Coding is an international language appreciated and utilised around the world. 
   Once this skill is learnt the world is truly your oyster <Body>
